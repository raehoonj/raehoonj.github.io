description: I finished Advent of Code 2020!

As a fun way to practice coding, I participated in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) this year. Each day in the month of December, a new pair of puzzles is uploaded. I took on a persona of a programmer who goes on a vacation, but encounters obstacles again and again. The story was quite amusing. I uploaded my codes for solving each puzzle [here](https://github.com/raehoonj/advent-of-code-2020). There were some easy ones, some brain teasers, and a few frustrating ones. I enjoyed the experience, and I might go at it again next year!
