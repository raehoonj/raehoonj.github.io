Raehoon is currently PhD student in the [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/BIG/). He is working on his thesis in [Martha Bulyk's lab](http://thebrain.bwh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School and the Genetic Division of Brigham & Women's Hospital. He is interested in studying how coding and noncoding genetic variants contribute to gene regulation and traits, including diseases.

When he is not working, he loves watching movies and [writing about them](https://welookback.wordpress.com/). He also enjoys reading novels and memoirs, listening to interview podcasts, and traveling to be amazed by architecture, nature, and food. He occasionally dances west coast swing, too.
