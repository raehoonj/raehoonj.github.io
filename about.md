I am currently PhD student in the [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/BIG/). I am working on my thesis in [Martha Bulyk's lab](http://thebrain.bwh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School and the Genetic Division of Brigham & Women's Hospital. I am interested in studying how coding and noncoding genetic variants contribute to gene regulation and traits, including diseases.

When I am not working, I love to watch movies and [write about them](https://welookback.wordpress.com/). I also enjoy reading novels and memoirs, listening to interview podcasts, and traveling to be amazed by architecture, nature, and food. I occasionally dance west coast swing, too.
