I am broadly interested in studying the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional regulation and, ultimately, traits and diseases.

## Transcriptional regulation

Current models in transcription posit that transcription factor binding in the *cis*-regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, control the expression of genes. I am fascinated by how different cell types can utilize the same genetic code (DNA), and yet express certain genes, but not others. I am studying how I can analyze various experimental data available (*e.g.* Hi-C, single-cell omics, and quantitative trait loci) to identify which enhancers regulate target genes.

## Statistical genetics

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) brought about an explosion of trait-associated genetic loci. However, mapping the precise causal variants and elucidating their mechanisms are very much a challenge. Noncoding variants, although they consist most of the GWAS discoveries, are especially difficult to study because their functional consequences cannot be predicted with a simple model. I am particularly interested in utilizing molecular phenotype data to pinpoint likely causal noncoding variants and shed light on potential target genes.
