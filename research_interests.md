I am broadly interested in studying the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional regulation and, ultimately, traits and diseases.

## Transcriptional regulation

Current models in transcription posit that transcription factor binding in the *cis*-regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, control the expression of genes. I am fascinated by how different cell types can utilize the same genetic code (DNA), and yet manifest distinct transcriptome (RNA).

## Statistical genetics

Genome-wide association studies brought about an explosion of genetic loci that are associated with traits.
